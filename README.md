# REACT QUIZ

This is a simple quiz application I built to practice working with the useReducer hook in React. It is a quiz comprising 15 questions on react.

- Each question can have 10, 20, or 30 points depending on the difficulty.
- There are a total of 7 minutes 30 seconds to finish the quiz.
- The quiz ends once the timer is up or all the questions have been answered.
